                <p><br>For me, this game is truly the definition of 'nostalgia.' It's a game that has aged well and I
                    hope
                    it will carry the childhood of many more people. <br> <br>The 100% was fun and not too complicated,

                <h2>Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</h2>
                <p><br>I played this game for the first time in September 2025. I was never really interested in
                    Spider-Man, but this game changed my perspective. Thanks to it, I watched all the Spider-Man movies,
                    including the ones with Miles. I watched everything and really enjoyed it all. I'm happy I started
                    this game!<br><br> The 100% was rather long, but really fun; I really enjoyed doing everything in
                    this game.</p>

                <p><br>After doing the first one, we had to do the next! This game was really good, I noticed a strong
                    improvement in the flying movements, it was smoother and so much fun, even the graphics improved.
                    Even though it was short, it was intense and perfect!<br><br> The 100% completion was short, I
                    finished the whole game in a few days, it was super fun but short</p>

                <p><br>This game was simply magnificent, I have nothing else to say. Really, everything has been
                    improved, whether it's the characters, the graphics, the movements, honestly the game was
                    incredible. <br> There are a lot of features that have been added and it really improved the
                    game!<br><br>
                    I thought getting 100% would take forever, but I actually managed it in ONE week (playing for
                    several hours a day haha). Honestly, the side missions are so fun and interesting, I really enjoyed
                    doing everything.</p>
