        <p>Hello, I am IT2ZDXDA², I am a producer from Belgium, I have always loved creating things, and yeah, I
            created this website.</p>
        <p id="pFirst">I started music in 2022, but I began posting in 2023, and I really launched on Spotify a
            few months later, around August to be precise.</p>
        <p id="pSecond">I like a lot of music styles but I specialize in phonk, I am
            talking about the phonk of 2022 and not Brazilian phonk.</p>
        <p id="pFinal">As I said, I have always loved to create things, I really enjoy coding and making music. If you
            have any
            questions, feel free to contact me on Discord (provided in the welcome section)</p>
        <p id="pEnd">(The website is not perfect yet, I made it solo so if you find any bugs, contact on
            Discord)</p>
